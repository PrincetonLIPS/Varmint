# Varmint
Formerly: The Variational Material Integrator

A robust and differentiable simulator for the statics and dynamics of large
deformation continuum mechanics, with a focus on designing Neuromechanical Autoencoders.

Uses Automatic Differentiation as a first-class citizen. Optimization is done directly
by computing gradients and sparse Hessians of the potential and kinetic energies.
Differentiation through the nonlinear solver is carried out through adjoint methods.
